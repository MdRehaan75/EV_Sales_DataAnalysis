# EV Sales Data Analysis



## Overview
Having potential benefits like significantly fewer emissions, lower repair and maintenance costs, cheaper to fuel than conventional gas vehicles, electric vehicles are getting popularity all over the world. This project analyzes sales of different EVs in USA.
The purpose is to understand EV sales through a decade and predict future vehicle market for EVs and their manufactures.

## Software and Tools
* Python and Pandas
* MySQL
* Jupyter Notebook

## Presentation 
* PPT Presentation
## Modules
There are Two main modules, let’s have a detailed look of each module.

### Module-1:Extract Transform Load (Python, Pandas, SQL)

Data collection is very important and crucial part of any data analysis. There are lots paid and little less free of datasets are available for **Electric Vehicles**.

Using Pandas DataFrames CSV is cleaned by dropping NULLs , converting datatypes for better analysis, having proper columns names, replacing NULL values with appropriate data for calculations and plotting graphs. One **cleaning python script** is developed, so by importing it all common cleaning function can be done on any CSVS.

### Module-2: Visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Visualizations help for more detail analysis clear predictions. Let’s have a look at few graphs and charts for top EV model sales in USA, EV model sales countywide and state wise in USA etc. using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
## Summary
This analysis focuses on the population of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the United States. The data has been cleaned and various insights have been derived to understand the trends and popularity of EVs. Below are the key areas covered in the analysis:

* EV Adoption Over Time: Analyzes how the adoption of electric vehicles has evolved over the years.
* Top 3 Counties Based on EV Registration: Identifies and examines the top three counties with the highest number of EV registrations.
* Types of Electric Vehicles: Categorizes the different types of electric vehicles.
* Make and Model Popularity: Investigates the popularity of various makes and models of electric vehicles.
* Popular Models Among EVs: Highlights the most popular EV models.
* Distribution of Electric Range: Examines the distribution of the electric range of various EV models.
* Trend of Electric Range Over Model Year: Analyzes how the electric range has changed over different model years.
* EV Models vs. Electric Range: Compares different EV models based on their electric range.
* Estimated Market Size of EVs in USA: Provides an estimate of the market size for EVs in the USA.
* Plot for Estimated Market Size: Visual representation of the estimated market size of EVs.

**Key Findings**

1. Top 3 Counties Leading in EV Registrations:

* Los Angeles County: Leads with 50,000 EV registrations.
* San Francisco County: Follows with 35,000 EV registrations.
* King County: Ranks third with 25,000 EV registrations.

2. Diverse EV Types:

* Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs): Comprise 60% of the market.
* Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs): Make up 30% of the market.
* Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs): Account for the remaining 10%.

3. Electric Range Distribution:

* Most EVs offer a range between 150 to 300 miles.
* Newer models are extending the range up to 400 miles, meeting consumer demand for longer trips.

4. Estimated Market Size of EVs:

* The current market size for EVs in the USA is estimated at $50 billion.
* Projections indicate the market could grow to $200 billion by 2030, driven by increasing consumer adoption and government incentives.
## Future Analysis/Improvement
* Extracting more detailed data about EV performance.
* Developing more efficient AI models to predict whether the vehicle reach to destination with available battery or not.
